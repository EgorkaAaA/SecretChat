# LazyChat a simple local network chat

Why LazyChat?
- The program can make connection with several devices on the same network.
- The program can just send texts there's no media yet.
- You don't have to provide the IP address to the client because it uses UDP Broadcasts to search all the possiple devices on the network. Inspierd from my work on <a href="www.lzmouse.com"> Lazy Mouse </a>
